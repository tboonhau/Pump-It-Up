Summary:
The objective is to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset as part of a competition named 'Pump It Up' organized by DrivenData. Some information about the waterpoints are given. Data comes from the Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water. In conclusion, it seemed from prediction that there are a lot waterpoints which are non functional but from the mapping, it showed that there are other functional waterpoints within the close proximity. However, the proportion of non functional waterpoints is significant.
